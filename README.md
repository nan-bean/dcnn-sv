# DCNN-SV
The DCNN-SV mainly focuses on session-independent speaker embedding learning using a dynamic convolution (DCNN) framework.

We provide both Tensorlfow and Pytorch implementation of DCNN framework for speaker verification:

* The TensorFlow implementation is currently being organized. Relevant files will be stored in the "dcnn_tf" directory and the whole project is coming soon.

* The PyTorch implementation is based on the [Wespeaker](https://github.com/wenet-e2e/wespeaker) open-source project. We provide the trained model for reproducing the best results on the VoxCeleb1-O dataset mentioned in the article, and more details can be found in the files under the "dcnn_torch" directory.
