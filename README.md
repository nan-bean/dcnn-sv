# DCNN-SV
The DCNN-SV mainly focuses on session-independent speaker embedding learning using a dynamic convolution (DCNN) framework.

We provide both Tensorflow (dcnn_tf) and Pytorch (dcnn_torch) implementation of DCNN framework for speaker verification:

* These two kinds of implementation are based on the off-the-shelf repository.

* An example project for nist sre16 experiments can be found in the "dcnn_tf" directory.   

* The trained model for reproducing the best VoxCeleb1-O results mentioned in the article, which is developed by the Pytorch toolkit. More details can be found in the "dcnn_torch" directory.
