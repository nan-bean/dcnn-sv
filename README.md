# DCNN-SV
The DCNN-SV mainly focuses on session-independent speaker embedding learning using a dynamic convolution (DCNN) framework.

We provide both Tensorflow and Pytorch implementation of DCNN framework for speaker verification:

* We provide the trained model for reproducing the best VoxCeleb1-O results mentioned in the article, which is developed by the Pytorch toolkit. More details can be found in the "dcnn_torch" directory.

* The TensorFlow implementation of DCNN framework is currently organizing. Relevant files will be stored in the "dcnn_tf" directory and the whole project is coming soon.
