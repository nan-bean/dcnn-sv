# DCNN-SV
The DCNN-SV mainly focuses on session-independent speaker embedding learning using a dynamic convolution (DCNN) framework.

We provide two types of DCNN implementations for speaker verification by using the TensorFlow and PyTorch deep learning toolkits:

* The TensorFlow implementation is currently being organized, and relevant files will be stored in the "dcnn_tf" directory. 

* The PyTorch implementation is based on the [Wespeaker](https://github.com/wenet-e2e/wespeaker) open-source project, and specific configurations can be found in the files under the "dcnn_torch" directory. We provide the trained model for reproducing the best results on the VoxCeleb1-O dataset mentioned in the article.
