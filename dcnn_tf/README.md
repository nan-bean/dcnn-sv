# Tensorflow DCNN
* The implementation is based on the [x-vector-kaldi-tf](https://github.com/BUTSpeechFIT/x-vector-kaldi-tf) repository. More details could refer to the original repository. This is an example project for experiments on the nist sre16. More examples could refer to the [kaldi](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi) toolkit.

* The model details can be found in the dcnn_tf/local/tf/models.py and dcnn_tf/local/tf/tf_block.py. You can transplant this portion of code into your model framework easily.
